\begin{abstract}
	% context
	Researchers interested in studying eye movement were the first to use eye-trackers in their investigations. Psychologists came next, mostly trying to find out connextions between eye-movements and cognitive states. Currently, many areas benefit from the tool, like neuromarketing, design, digital gaming, visual attention, and emotion modeling. Now, eye-tracking systems are widely spread and there is a large variety of models, prices and quality. The choice of a specific equipment depends on the requirements of the intended application. 

	% gap
	Crowdsoucing is another area which would be enormously boosted with the aid of such a tool. However, for crowdsourcing to really work, the data acquisition apparatus, including the eye-tracker shoud be as cheap as possible. Particularly, point of regard accuracy is an issue. Generally, low cost eye-trackers suffer from poor quality, because the apparatus to acquire the user image is simple, as expected, based on webcams without infra-red illumination.
	
	% proposal
	This paper presents a technique to improve the accuracy of low-cost eye-trackers by using dynamic visual attention models. Basically, the visual attention model works as a filter to reduce noise in point of regard estimations and at the same time correct them to the most probable scene location.
	
	% methodology
	The technique efficiency is demonstrated experimentaly where we use two eye-trackers in parallel to collect data: one is a comercial equipment with pretty good accuracy (acc here) whereas the other is a low-cost webcam-based software eye-tracker (measured acc of...). We performed comparisons between original and corrected low-cost PoRs against comercial PoR by using heatmaps and scanpath metrics.

	% results and conclusions
	Our results show an improvement...
