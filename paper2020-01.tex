	% context
	The development of the first eye-tracking systems can be traced back to the early years of the 20th century, when researchers were trying to uderstand the behavior of eye movements during reading. Psychologists came right after, mostly trying to find out connections between eye movements and cognitive states. Eye-trackers are becoming a common device with a large variety of models, prices and quality, whose selection depends on the intended application. Presently, many areas benefit from eye-tracking, like neuromarketing, design, human-computer interfacing, visual attention studies, and emotion modeling. Crowdsoucing is another field which would be greatly boosted with the aid of such a tool.

	% gap
	 However, to be feasible, the data acquisition apparatus for crowdsourcing should be inexpensive. And, as a rule, point of regard (PoR) estimations in low-cost eye-trackers suffer from poor accuracy. % the user image is simple, as expected, based on webcams without infra-red illumination/.
	
	% proposal
	This paper presents a technique to improve the quality of low-cost eye-trackers by using visual attention models. Basically, the visual attention model filters noisy gaze estimations and at the same time corrects PoRs to the most salient location in a certain neighborhood.
	
	% methodology
	The technique performance is assessed experimentaly, where we use two eye-trackers in parallel to collect data: one is a comercial equipment with nominal accuracy of XX, assumed as a ground-truth provider, whereas the other is a low-cost webcam-based software eye-tracker (measured acc of XXX). We compare original and corrected low-cost PoRs against reference PoR by using heatmaps and scanpath metrics.

	% results and conclusions
	Our results show an improvement... (do not forget the drawbacks).
